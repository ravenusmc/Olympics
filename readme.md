# Olympics 
## Intro

  This is another data project however it will be focused on the 2016 olympics. The site that I will be using to get my data will be: http://www.nbcolympics.com/medals. It will only be looking at medals but I may expand it out to look at other parts of the Olympics as well. 


# Getting started
### Installing 

  Other than Python 3.4 or simply Python 3.X you will also need pymongo, pandas, numpy, BeautifulSoup, requests and matplotlib.pyplot installed.
